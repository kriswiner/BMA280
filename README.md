# BMA280

The BMA280 is an inexpensive (~$1), three-axis, high-resolution (14-bit) accelerometer in a tiny 2 mm x 2 mm LGA12 package with 32-slot FIFO, 
two multifunction interrupts and widely configurable sample rate (15 - 2000 Hz), full range (2 - 16 g), low power modes, 
and interrupt detection behaviors. This accelerometer is nice choice for low-frequency sound and vibration analysis,
tap detection and simple orientation estimation.
